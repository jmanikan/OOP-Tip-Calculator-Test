# OOP Themed Tip Calculator

This is a program to practise using classes and interaction between classes.

The idea is to have the user input information to create an instance of the class
Human with their name and amount of money - not necessarily realistic - and make
an instance of a TipCalculator class through the class method of the created Human.
The instance of Human created by the player then "has" the calculator and the calculator
"has" him or her as it's owner. Through another Human class method, the user would then 
use his or her calculator to calculate the tip for a bill and split the check. The share 
of the bill would then be compared to the Human's own money to see if he or she can
afford it. If he or she can afford it, then it would be subtracted from the Human's 
money.
